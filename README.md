Introduction
============

The LibMimeMail project is a C++ library allowing you to build emails with
any number of parts. Specifically, it allows you to add attachments and
create HTML emails.


TODO
====

We want to implement full coverage tests for this library. The `sendmail`
tool can be replace by a test version so we can capture the output and see
that it is as expected. Similarly, we can work on the HTML to Plain Text
tool with our own test version.


Bugs
====

Submit bug reports and patches on
